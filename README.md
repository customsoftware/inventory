# Home Inventory
This is Julias home grocery inventory application

It is an iPad-only application. It will have a launch screen with four buttons:

1. Generate a shopping list
2. Add items to inventory
3. Remove/Consume items in inventory
4. Edit the inventory

The presentation will be a Master-Detail 1-Detail 2 view

The plan is to have a bar code scanner to add and remove items from the inventory. The shopping report will be emailed to Julia as she has an Android.
